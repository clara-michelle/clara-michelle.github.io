        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p class="darkblue">I am a Hong Kong-born Canadian curently living in Pittsburgh, PA with my husband and our 7-year-old mini labradoodle named Mochi. I am a Professor of Psychology at <a href="https://www.carlow.edu" target="_blank">Carlow University</a> as well as the Director of the Undergraduate Psychology Program and the Interim Associate Dean of Faculty Professional Development for the College of Arts and Sciences. I currently teach classes in social psychology and statistics. A few years ago I also earned a certificate in American Sign Language and I now co-organize a monthly local ASL meetup.</p>
        <p class="darkblue">Mochi and I are a certified pet therapy team with the <a href="https://www.therapydogs.com/" target="_blank">Alliance of Therapy Dogs</a>. Here we are volunteering at a wellness event at Carlow:</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
            <p class="darkgreen">I have been a singer all my life, but in the past few years I became involved in musical theatre and I think I have finally found my niche! I have played Lisa in <i>Mamma Mia</i>, a Gaston Girl in <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, and Doody in <i>Grease</i> (my favorite role so far). Currently, I am preparing to audition for <i>The Addams Family.</i>
